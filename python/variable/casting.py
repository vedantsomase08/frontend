# If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

x = str(3)
y = int(5)
z = float(9)


# You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.

a = 12
b = "Python"
print(type(a))
print(type(b))

# String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes.

name = "John"
# is the same as
names = 'John'
