# Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
# A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
# Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)

# Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964,
  "year": 2020
}
print(thisdict)

# You can access the items of a dictionary by referring to its key name, inside square brackets:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
x = thisdict["model"]

# There is also a method called get() that will give you the same result:
thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
x = thisdict.get("model")
print(x)

# The keys() method will return a list of all the keys in the dictionary.
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
x = thisdict.keys()
print(x)

# The values() method will return a list of all the values in the dictionary.
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
x = thisdict.values()
print(x)

# Add new value 
car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
x = car.items()
print(x) #before the change
car["year"] = 2020
print(x) #after the change

# A dictionary can contain dictionaries, this is called nested dictionaries.
