# Python Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

# In Python 3.x the result of division is a floating-point while in Python 2.x division of 2 integers was an integer. To obtain an integer result in Python 3.x floored (// integer) is used.



# Variables
a = 15
b = 4

# Addition
print("Addition:", a + b)  

# Subtraction
print("Subtraction:", a - b) 

# Multiplication
print("Multiplication:", a * b)  

# Division
print("Division:", a / b) 

# Floor Division
print("Floor Division:", a // b)  

# Modulus
print("Modulus:", a % b) 

# Exponentiation
print("Exponentiation:", a ** b)
