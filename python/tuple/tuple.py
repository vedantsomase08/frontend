# Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

# Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

# A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

# Tuples are written with round brackets.


thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple)

# To determine how many items a tuple has, use the len() function:
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(len(thistuple))

# A tuple with strings, integers and boolean values:
tuple1 = ("abc", 34, True, 40, "male")

# Using the tuple() method to make a tuple:
thistuple = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(thistuple)



#Other All Methods Same as list
